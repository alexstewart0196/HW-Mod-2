In working on this project I was able to find almost everything I needed in our GitLab and going through class notes and activities. I used office hours to help with looping the code through every worksheet
Starting at greatest percent increase, decrease and total volume, I had some questions so I scheduled a tutor session with Simon. He was able to help me with that and I was able to work through the rest of the module on that call.
Here are the online resouces I used.
